# mode blocks it outright rather than relying on a prompt to keep it well-behaved.

# returns the inverse: every known tool name minus the allowlist.
#
# Known tool names come from FUNCTION_TOOL_SCHEMAS, but that source is imperfect:
# some tools are only XML-invocable (e.g. manage_notes, generate_image) and never
# appear there, and the import can fail outright. Either gap would drop a mutating
# tool from the subtraction and silently leave it enabled. This set is the static
# backstop for both: union it in so known mutators are always subtracted, and so a
# failed import still blocks them (fail closed, never open). Only mutators belong
# here — read-only tools are covered by the allowlist. Keep in sync when adding
# new mutating tools.
